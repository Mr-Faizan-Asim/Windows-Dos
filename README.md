## Windows DOS Shell using Tree Structure
This project demonstrates a simple DOS Shell implemented using a Tree Structure in C programming. The application simulates a basic file system navigator with the ability to explore files and directories using tree-like data structure. The shell behaves similarly to a Windows command prompt, where users can issue commands to view and navigate through directories and files.

## Learning Experience
This project was developed as part of my studies to better understand tree structures and their applications. The tree is an ideal data structure for representing a file system hierarchy, where each node is either a directory or a file, and branches represent nested subdirectories.

Through this project, I applied the following concepts:

Tree Data Structure: Representing directories and files as a hierarchical structure.
Pointer Manipulation: Dynamically creating, navigating, and deleting nodes.
File Handling: Simulating file navigation and operations like changing directories (cd), listing directories (dir), and exiting the shell.
